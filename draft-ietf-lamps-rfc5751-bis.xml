    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        S/&wj;MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) provides a
        consistent way to send and receive secure MIME data.  Based on the
        popular Internet MIME standard, S/&wj;MIME provides the following
        cryptographic security services for electronic messaging
        applications:  authentication, message integrity and non-repudiation
        of origin (using digital signatures), and data confidentiality (using
        encryption).  As a supplementary service, S/&wj;MIME provides for message
        compression.
      </t>

      <t>
        S/&wj;MIME can be used by traditional mail user agents (MUAs) to add
        cryptographic security services to mail that is sent, and to
        interpret cryptographic security services in mail that is received.
        However, S/&wj;MIME is not restricted to mail; it can be used with any
        transport mechanism that transports MIME data, such as HTTP or SIP.
        As such, S/&wj;MIME takes advantage of the object-based features of MIME
        and allows secure messages to be exchanged in mixed-transport
        systems.
      </t>
      <t>
        Further, S/&wj;MIME can be used in automated message transfer agents that
        use cryptographic security services that do not require any human
        intervention, such as the signing of software-generated documents and
        the encryption of FAX messages sent over the Internet.
      </t>
      <section title="Specification Overview" anchor="SpecOverview">

        <t>
          This document describes a protocol for adding cryptographic signature
          and encryption services to MIME data.  The MIME standard <xref target="MIME-SPEC"/>
          provides a general structure for the content of Internet messages and
          allows extensions for new content-type-based applications.
        </t>
        <t>
          This specification defines how to create a MIME body part that has
          been cryptographically enhanced according to the Cryptographic
          Message Syntax (CMS) <xref target="CMS"/>, which is derived from PKCS #7
          <xref target="RFC2315"/>.  This specification also defines the application/&wj;pkcs7-mime
          media type that can be used to transport those body parts.
        </t>
        <t>
          This document also discusses how to use the multipart/&wj;signed media
          type defined in <xref target="RFC1847"/> to transport S/&wj;MIME signed messages.
          multipart/&wj;signed is used in conjunction with the
          application/&wj;pkcs7-signature media type, which is used to transport a detached S/&wj;MIME
          signature.
        </t>
        <t>
          In order to create S/&wj;MIME messages, an S/&wj;MIME agent MUST follow the
          specifications in this document, as well as the specifications listed
          in the Cryptographic Message Syntax document <xref target="CMS"/>, <xref target="RFC3370"/>,
          <xref target="RFC4056"/>, <xref target="RFC3560"/>, and <xref target="RFC5754"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          Throughout this specification, there are requirements and
          recommendations made for how receiving agents handle incoming
          messages.  There are separate requirements and recommendations for
          how sending agents create outgoing messages.  In general, the best
          strategy is to "be liberal in what you receive and conservative in
          what you send".  Most of the requirements are placed on the handling
          of incoming messages, while the recommendations are mostly on the
          creation of outgoing messages.
        </t>
        <t>
          The separation for requirements on receiving agents and sending
          agents also derives from the likelihood that there will be S/&wj;MIME
          systems that involve software other than traditional Internet mail
          clients.  S/&wj;MIME can be used with any system that transports MIME
          data.  An automated process that sends an encrypted message might not
          be able to receive an encrypted message at all, for example.  Thus,
          the requirements and recommendations for the two types of agents are
          listed separately when appropriate.

          The result of this is placed in the message-digest attribute of the signed attributes.
          It is RECOMMENDED that the algorithm used for digesting the body of the message be of similar or greater strength than the signature algorithm.

        <t>
          Both ECDSA and EdDSA are included in the list of required algorithms for political reasons.
          NIST is unable to provide the seeds that were used to create their standardized curves, this means that there is a section of the community which believes that there might be a backdoor to these curves.
          The EdDSA curves were, in part, created in response to this feeling.
          However, there are still significant sections of the industry which need to have NIST approved algorithms.
          For this reason, both sets of curves are represented in the recieving agent list, but there is only a requirement for curve in the sending agent list.

      <section title="General Syntax">
        <t>
          There are several CMS content types.  Of these, only the Data,
          SignedData, EnvelopedData, AuthEnvelopedData, and CompressedData content types are
          currently used for S/&wj;MIME.
        </t>
        <section title="Data Content Type">
          <t>
            Sending agents MUST use the id-data content type identifier to
            identify the "inner" MIME message content.  For example, when
            applying a digital signature to MIME data, the CMS SignedData
            encapContentInfo eContentType MUST include the id-data object
            identifier and the media type MUST be stored in the SignedData
            encapContentInfo eContent OCTET STRING (unless the sending agent is
            using multipart/&wj;signed, in which case the eContent is absent, per
            <xref target="SignMultipart"/> of this document).  As another example, when applying
            encryption to MIME data, the CMS EnvelopedData encryptedContentInfo
            contentType MUST include the id-data object identifier and the
            encrypted MIME content MUST be stored in the EnvelopedData
            encryptedContentInfo encryptedContent OCTET STRING.
          </t>
        </section>

        <section title="SignedData Content Type">
          <t>
            Sending agents MUST use the SignedData content type to apply a
            digital signature to a message or, in a degenerate case where there
            is no signature information, to convey certificates.  Applying a
            signature to a message provides authentication, message integrity,
            and non-repudiation of origin.
          </t>
        </section>

        <section title="EnvelopedData Content Type">
          <t>
            This content type is used to apply data confidentiality to a message.
            A sender needs to have access to a public key for each intended
            message recipient to use this service.

            This content type is used to apply data confidentiality and message integrity to a message.

            A sender needs to have access to a public key for each intended
            message recipient to use this service.
          </t>
        </section>

        <section title="CompressedData Content Type">
          <t>
            This content type is used to apply data compression to a message.
            This content type does not provide authentication, message integrity,
            non-repudiation, or data confidentiality, and is only used to reduce
            the message's size.
          </t>

          attributes along with a signature.
        </t>
        <t>
          Receiving agents MUST be able to handle zero or one instance of each
          of the signed attributes listed here.  Sending agents SHOULD generate
          one instance of each of the following signed attributes in each
          S/&wj;MIME message:

          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          Further, receiving agents SHOULD be able to handle zero or one
          instance of the signingCertificate and signingCertificatev2 signed
          attributes, as defined in Section 5 of RFC 2634 <xref target="ESS"/> and Section 3
          of RFC 5035 <xref target="ESS"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          Sending agents SHOULD generate one instance of the signingCertificate
          or signingCertificatev2 signed attribute in each SignerInfo
          structure.
        </t>
        <t>
          Additional attributes and values for these attributes might be
          defined in the future.  Receiving agents SHOULD handle attributes or
          values that they do not recognize in a graceful manner.
        </t>
        <t>
          Interactive sending agents that include signed attributes that are
          not listed here SHOULD display those attributes to the user, so that
          the user is aware of all of the data being signed.
        </t>

        <section title="Signing Time Attribute" anchor="SignTime">
          <t>
            The signing-time attribute is used to convey the time that a message
            was signed.  The time of signing will most likely be created by a
            message originator and therefore is only as trustworthy as the
            originator.

              We could kill this section and just reference RFC5652 if we wanted.
            </cref>
          </t>
          <t>
            Sending agents MUST encode signing time through the year 2049 as
            UTCTime; signing times in 2050 or later MUST be encoded as
            GeneralizedTime.  When the UTCTime CHOICE is used, S/&wj;MIME agents MUST
            interpret the year field (YY) as follows:
            <list style="none">
              <t>
                If YY is greater than or equal to 50, the year is interpreted as
                19YY; if YY is less than 50, the year is interpreted as 20YY.
              </t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>
            Receiving agents MUST be able to process signing-time attributes that
            are encoded in either UTCTime or GeneralizedTime.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section title="SMIME Capabilities Attribute" anchor="SMIMECaps">
          <t>
            The SMIMECapabilities attribute includes signature algorithms (such
            as "sha256WithRSAEncryption"), symmetric algorithms (such as "AES-128
            CBC"), authenticated symmetric algorithms (such as "AES-128 GCM") and key encipherment algorithms (such as "rsaEncryption").
            There are also several identifiers that indicate support for other
            optional features such as binary encoding and compression.  The
            SMIMECapabilities were designed to be flexible and extensible so
            that, in the future, a means of identifying other capabilities and
            preferences such as certificates can be added in a way that will not
            cause current clients to break.
          </t>
          <t>
            If present, the SMIMECapabilities attribute MUST be a
            SignedAttribute; it MUST NOT be an UnsignedAttribute.  CMS defines
            SignedAttributes as a SET OF Attribute.  The SignedAttributes in a
            signerInfo MUST NOT include multiple instances of the
            SMIMECapabilities attribute.  CMS defines the ASN.1 syntax for
            Attribute to include attrValues SET OF AttributeValue.  A
            SMIMECapabilities attribute MUST only include a single instance of
            AttributeValue.  There MUST NOT be zero or multiple instances of
            AttributeValue present in the attrValues SET OF AttributeValue.
          </t>
          <t>
            The semantics of the SMIMECapabilities attribute specify a partial
            list as to what the client announcing the SMIMECapabilities can
            support.  A client does not have to list every capability it
            supports, and need not list all its capabilities so that the
            capabilities list doesn't get too long.  In an SMIMECapabilities
            attribute, the object identifiers (OIDs) are listed in order of their
            preference, but SHOULD be separated logically along the lines of
            their categories (signature algorithms, symmetric algorithms, key
            encipherment algorithms, etc.).
          </t>
          <t>
            The structure of the SMIMECapabilities attribute is to facilitate
            simple table lookups and binary comparisons in order to determine
            matches.  For instance, the DER-encoding for the SMIMECapability for
            AES-128 CBC MUST be identically encoded regardless of the
            implementation.  Because of the requirement for identical encoding,
            individuals documenting algorithms to be used in the
            SMIMECapabilities attribute SHOULD explicitly document the correct
            byte sequence for the common cases.
          </t>
          <t>
            For any capability, the associated parameters for the OID MUST
            specify all of the parameters necessary to differentiate between two
            instances of the same algorithm.
          </t>
          <t>
            The OIDs that correspond to algorithms SHOULD use the same OID as the
            actual algorithm, except in the case where the algorithm usage is
            ambiguous from the OID.  For instance, in an earlier specification,
            rsaEncryption was ambiguous because it could refer to either a
            signature algorithm or a key encipherment algorithm.  In the event
            that an OID is ambiguous, it needs to be arbitrated by the maintainer
            of the registered SMIMECapabilities list as to which type of
            algorithm will use the OID, and a new OID MUST be allocated under the
            smimeCapabilities OID to satisfy the other use of the OID.
          </t>
          <t>
            The registered SMIMECapabilities list specifies the parameters for
            OIDs that need them, most notably key lengths in the case of
            variable-length symmetric ciphers.  In the event that there are no
            differentiating parameters for a particular OID, the parameters MUST
            be omitted, and MUST NOT be encoded as NULL.  Additional values for
            the SMIMECapabilities attribute might be defined in the future.
            Receiving agents MUST handle a SMIMECapabilities object that has
            values that it does not recognize in a graceful manner.

        <section title="Encryption Key Preference Attribute" anchor="EncryptKeyPref">
          <t>
            The encryption key preference attribute allows the signer to
            unambiguously describe which of the signer's certificates has the
            signer's preferred encryption key.  This attribute is designed to
            enhance behavior for interoperating with those clients that use
            separate keys for encryption and signing.  This attribute is used to
            convey to anyone viewing the attribute which of the listed
            certificates is appropriate for encrypting a session key for future
            encrypted messages.
          </t>
          <t>
            If present, the SMIMEEncryptionKeyPreference attribute MUST be a
            SignedAttribute; it MUST NOT be an UnsignedAttribute.  CMS defines
            SignedAttributes as a SET OF Attribute.  The SignedAttributes in a
            signerInfo MUST NOT include multiple instances of the
            SMIMEEncryptionKeyPreference attribute.  CMS defines the ASN.1 syntax
            for Attribute to include attrValues SET OF AttributeValue.  A
            SMIMEEncryptionKeyPreference attribute MUST only include a single
            instance of AttributeValue.  There MUST NOT be zero or multiple
            instances of AttributeValue present in the attrValues SET OF
            AttributeValue.
          </t>
          <t>
            The sending agent SHOULD include the referenced certificate in the
            set of certificates included in the signed message if this attribute
            is used.  The certificate MAY be omitted if it has been previously
            made available to the receiving agent.  Sending agents SHOULD use
            this attribute if the commonly used or preferred encryption
            certificate is not the same as the certificate used to sign the
            message.
          </t>
          <t>
            Receiving agents SHOULD store the preference data if the signature on
            the message is valid and the signing time is greater than the
            currently stored value.  (As with the SMIMECapabilities, the clock
            skew SHOULD be checked and the data not used if the skew is too
            great.)  Receiving agents SHOULD respect the sender's encryption key
            preference attribute if possible.  This, however, represents only a
            preference and the receiving agent can use any certificate in
            replying to the sender that is valid.

              In order to determine the key management certificate to be used when
              sending a future CMS EnvelopedData message for a particular
              recipient, the following steps SHOULD be followed:

                  If an SMIMEEncryptionKeyPreference attribute is not found in a

                  X.509 certificates SHOULD be searched for a X.509 certificate with

                  encryption cannot be done with the signer of the message.  If
                  multiple X.509 key management certificates are found, the S/&wj;MIME

              When a sending agent creates an encrypted message, it has to decide
              which type of encryption to use.  The decision process involves using
              information garnered from the capabilities lists included in messages
              received from the recipient, as well as out-of-band information such
              as private agreements, user preferences, legal restrictions, and so
              on.
            </t>

              <xref target="SMIMECaps"/> defines a method by which a sending agent can
              optionally announce, among other things, its decrypting capabilities
              in its order of preference.  The following method for processing and
              remembering the encryption capabilities attribute in incoming signed
              messages SHOULD be used.
              <list style="symbols">
                <t>
                  If the receiving agent has not yet created a list of
                  capabilities for the sender's public key, then, after verifying
                  the signature on the incoming message and checking the
                  timestamp, the receiving agent SHOULD create a new list
                  containing at least the signing time and the symmetric
                  capabilities.
                </t>
                <t>
                  If such a list already exists, the receiving agent SHOULD verify
                  that the signing time in the incoming message is greater than
                  the signing time stored in the list and that the signature is
                  valid.  If so, the receiving agent SHOULD update both the
                  signing time and capabilities in the list.  Values of the
                  signing time that lie far in the future (that is, a greater
                  discrepancy than any reasonable clock skew), or a capabilities
                  list in messages whose signature could not be verified, MUST NOT

            <t>
              Before sending a message, the sending agent MUST decide whether it is
              willing to use weak encryption for the particular data in the
              message.  If the sending agent decides that weak encryption is
              unacceptable for this data, then the sending agent MUST NOT use a
              weak algorithm.  The decision to use or not use weak encryption
              overrides any other decision in this section about which encryption

        <section title="Creating S/MIME Messages">
          <t>
            This section describes the S/&wj;MIME message formats and how they are
            created.  S/&wj;MIME messages are a combination of MIME bodies and CMS
            content types.  Several media types as well as several CMS content
            types are used.  The data to be secured is always a canonical MIME
            entity.  The MIME entity and other data, such as certificates and
            algorithm identifiers, are given to CMS processing facilities that
            produce a CMS object.  Finally, the CMS object is wrapped in MIME.
            The Enhanced Security Services for S/&wj;MIME <xref target="ESS"/> document provides
            descriptions of how nested, secured S/&wj;MIME messages are formatted.
            ESS provides a description of how a triple-wrapped S/&wj;MIME message is
            formatted using multipart/&wj;signed and application/&wj;pkcs7-mime for the
            signatures.
          </t>
          <t>
            S/&wj;MIME provides one format for enveloped-only data, several formats
            for signed-only data, and several formats for signed and enveloped
            data.  Several formats are required to accommodate several
            environments, in particular for signed messages.  The criteria for
            choosing among these formats are also described.
          </t>
          <t>

            The reader of this section is expected to understand MIME as
            described in <xref target="MIME-SPEC"/> and <xref target="RFC1847"/>.
          </t>

          <section title="Preparing the MIME Entity for Signing, Enveloping, or Compressing" anchor="MimePrep">
            <t>
              S/&wj;MIME is used to secure MIME entities.  A MIME entity can be a sub-
              part, sub-parts of a message, or the whole message with all its sub-
              parts.  A MIME entity that is the whole message includes only the
              MIME message headers and MIME body, and does not include the RFC-822
              header.  Note that S/&wj;MIME can also be used to secure MIME entities
              used in applications other than Internet mail.  If protection of the
              RFC-822 header is required, the use of the message/rfc822 media type
              is explained later in this section.
            </t>
            <t>
              The MIME entity that is secured and described in this section can be
              thought of as the "inside" MIME entity.  That is, it is the
              "innermost" object in what is possibly a larger MIME message.
              Processing "outside" MIME entities into CMS content types is
              described in <xref target="pkcs7-mime-media-type"/>, <xref target="Signed-Only"/>, and elsewhere.
            </t>
            <t>
              The procedure for preparing a MIME entity is given in <xref target="MIME-SPEC"/>.
              The same procedure is used here with some additional restrictions
              when signing.  The description of the procedures from <xref target="MIME-SPEC"/> is
              repeated here, but it is suggested that the reader refer to that
              document for the exact procedure.  This section also describes
              additional requirements.
            </t>
            <t>
              A single procedure is used for creating MIME entities that are to
              have any combination of signing, enveloping, and compressing applied.
              Some additional steps are recommended to defend against known
              corruptions that can occur during mail transport that are of
              particular importance for clear-signing using the multipart/&wj;signed
              format.  It is recommended that these additional steps be performed
              on enveloped messages, or signed and enveloped messages, so that the
              message can be forwarded to any environment without modification.
            </t>
            <t>
              These steps are descriptive rather than prescriptive.  The
              implementer is free to use any procedure as long as the result is the

              When an S/&wj;MIME message is received, the security services on the
              message are processed, and the result is the MIME entity.  That MIME
              entity is typically passed to a MIME-capable user agent where it is

              In order to protect outer, non-content-related message header fields
              (for instance, the "Subject", "To", "From", and "Cc" fields), the
              sending client MAY wrap a full MIME message in a message/rfc822
              wrapper in order to apply S/&wj;MIME security services to these header
              fields.  It is up to the receiving client to decide how to present
              this "inner" header along with the unprotected "outer" header.

            <t>
              When an S/&wj;MIME message is received, if the top-level protected MIME
              entity has a Content-Type of message/rfc822, it can be assumed that
              the intent was to provide header protection.  This entity SHOULD be
              presented as the top-level message, taking into account header
              merging issues as previously discussed.

            <section title="Canonicalization" anchor="Canonicalization">
              <t>
                Each MIME entity MUST be converted to a canonical form that is
                uniquely and unambiguously representable in the environment where the
                signature is created and the environment where the signature will be
                verified.  MIME entities MUST be canonicalized for enveloping and
                compressing as well as signing.
              </t>
              <t>
                The exact details of canonicalization depend on the actual media type
                and subtype of an entity, and are not described here.  Instead, the
                standard for the particular media type SHOULD be consulted.  For
                example, canonicalization of type text/plain is different from
                canonicalization of audio/basic.  Other than text types, most types
                have only one representation regardless of computing platform or
                environment that can be considered their canonical representation.
                In general, canonicalization will be performed by the non-security
                part of the sending agent rather than the S/&wj;MIME implementation.
              </t>
              <t>
                The most common and important canonicalization is for text, which is
                often represented differently in different environments.  MIME
                entities of major type "text" MUST have both their line endings and
                character set canonicalized.  The line ending MUST be the pair of
                characters &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;, and the charset SHOULD be a registered charset
                <xref target="CHARSETS"/>.  The details of the canonicalization are specified in
                <xref target="MIME-SPEC"/>.
              </t>
              <t>
                Note that some charsets such as ISO-2022 have multiple
                representations for the same characters.  When preparing such text
                for signing, the canonical representation specified for the charset
                MUST be used.

            <section title="Transfer Encoding">
              <t>
                When generating any of the secured MIME entities below, except the
                signing using the multipart/&wj;signed format, no transfer encoding is
                required at all.  S/&wj;MIME implementations MUST be able to deal with
                binary MIME objects.  If no Content-Transfer-Encoding header field is
                present, the transfer encoding is presumed to be 7BIT.
              </t>
              <t>
                S/&wj;MIME implementations SHOULD however use transfer encoding described
                in <xref target="Transfer-multipart"/> for all MIME entities they secure.  The reason for
                securing only 7-bit MIME entities, even for enveloped data that are
                not exposed to the transport, is that it allows the MIME entity to be
                handled in any environment without changing it.  For example, a
                trusted gateway might remove the envelope, but not the signature, of
                a message, and then forward the signed message on to the end
                recipient so that they can verify the signatures directly.  If the
                transport internal to the site is not 8-bit clean, such as on a wide-
                area network with a single mail gateway, verifying the signature will
                not be possible unless the original MIME entity was only 7-bit data.
              </t>
              <t>
                S/&wj;MIME implementations that "know" that all intended recipients are
                capable of handling inner (all but the outermost) binary MIME objects
                SHOULD use binary encoding as opposed to a 7-bit-safe transfer
                encoding for the inner entities.  The use of a 7-bit-safe encoding
                (such as base64) would unnecessarily expand the message size.
                Implementations MAY "know" that recipient implementations are capable
                of handling inner binary MIME entities either by interpreting the id-
                cap-preferBinaryInside SMIMECapabilities attribute, by prior
                agreement, or by other means.
              </t>
              <t>
                If one or more intended recipients are unable to handle inner binary
                MIME objects, or if this capability is unknown for any of the
                intended recipients, S/&wj;MIME implementations SHOULD use transfer
                encoding described in <xref target="Transfer-multipart"/> for all MIME entities they
                secure.

              <t>
                If a multipart/&wj;signed entity is ever to be transmitted over the
                standard Internet SMTP infrastructure or other transport that is
                constrained to 7-bit text, it MUST have transfer encoding applied so
                that it is represented as 7-bit text.  MIME entities that are 7-bit
                data already need no transfer encoding.  Entities such as 8-bit text
                and binary data can be encoded with quoted-printable or base-64
                transfer encoding.
              </t>
              <t>
                The primary reason for the 7-bit requirement is that the Internet
                mail transport infrastructure cannot guarantee transport of 8-bit or
                binary data.  Even though many segments of the transport
                infrastructure now handle 8-bit and even binary data, it is sometimes
                not possible to know whether the transport path is 8-bit clean.  If a
                mail message with 8-bit data were to encounter a message transfer
                agent that cannot transmit 8-bit or binary data, the agent has three
                options, none of which are acceptable for a clear-signed message:
                <list style="symbols">
                  <t>
                    The agent could change the transfer encoding; this would
                    invalidate the signature.
                  </t>
                  <t>
                    The agent could transmit the data anyway, which would most likely
                    result in the 8th bit being corrupted; this too would invalidate
                    the signature.
                  </t>
                  <t>
                    The agent could return the message to the sender.

                <xref target="RFC1847"/> prohibits an agent from changing the transfer encoding

                multipart/&wj;signed message with 8-bit or binary data in the first part,
                it would have to return the message to the sender as undeliverable.

=A1Hola Michael!

How do you like the new S/MIME specification?

It's generally a good idea to encode lines that begin with
From=20because some mail transport agents will insert a greater-
than (&gt;) sign, thus invalidating the signature.

Also, in some cases it might be desirable to encode any =20
trailing whitespace that occurs on lines in order to ensure =20
that the message signature is not invalidated when passing =20
a gateway that modifies such whitespace (like BITNET). =20

              <t>
                The application/&wj;pkcs7-mime media type is used to carry CMS content
                types including EnvelopedData, SignedData, and CompressedData.  The
                details of constructing these entities are described in subsequent
                sections.  This section describes the general characteristics of the
                application/&wj;pkcs7-mime media type.
              </t>
              <t>
                The carried CMS object always contains a MIME entity that is prepared
                as described in <xref target="MimePrep"/> if the eContentType is id-data.  Other
                contents MAY be carried when the eContentType contains different
                values.  See <xref target="ESS"/> for an example of this with signed receipts.
              </t>
              <t>
                Since CMS content types are binary data, in most cases base-64
                transfer encoding is appropriate, in particular, when used with SMTP
                transport.  The transfer encoding used depends on the transport
                through which the object is to be sent, and is not a characteristic
                of the media type.
              </t>
              <t>
                Note that this discussion refers to the transfer encoding of the CMS
                object or "outside" MIME entity.  It is completely distinct from, and
                unrelated to, the transfer encoding of the MIME entity secured by the
                CMS object, the "inside" object, which is described in <xref target="MimePrep"/>.
              </t>
              <t>
                Because there are several types of application/&wj;pkcs7-mime objects, a
                sending agent SHOULD do as much as possible to help a receiving agent
                know about the contents of the object without forcing the receiving
                agent to decode the ASN.1 for the object.  The Content-Type header
                field of all application/&wj;pkcs7-mime objects SHOULD include the
                optional "smime-type" parameter, as described in the following
                sections.
              </t>




              <section title="The name and filename Parameters">
                <t>
                  For the application/&wj;pkcs7-mime, sending agents SHOULD emit the
                  optional "name" parameter to the Content-Type field for compatibility
                  with older systems.  Sending agents SHOULD also emit the optional
                  Content-Disposition field <xref target="RFC2138"/> with the "filename" parameter.
                  If a sending agent emits the above parameters, the value of the
                  parameters SHOULD be a file name with the appropriate extension:
                </t>
                
                  <texttable style="none">

                    <c>application/pkcs7-signature (SignedData)</c><c>.p7s</c>
                  </texttable>
                <t>

                  In addition, the file name SHOULD be limited to eight characters
                  followed by a three-letter extension.  The eight-character filename
                  base can be any distinct name; the use of the filename base "smime"
                  SHOULD be used to indicate that the MIME entity is associated with
                  S/&wj;MIME.
                </t>
                <t>

                  Including a file name serves two purposes.  It facilitates easier use
                  of S/&wj;MIME objects as files on disk.  It also can convey type
                  information across gateways.  When a MIME entity of type
                  application/&wj;pkcs7-mime (for example) arrives at a gateway that has no
                  special knowledge of S/&wj;MIME, it will default the entity's media type
                  to application/&wj;octet-stream and treat it as a generic attachment,
                  thus losing the type information.  However, the suggested filename
                  for an attachment is often carried across a gateway.  This often
                  allows the receiving systems to determine the appropriate application
                  to hand the attachment off to, in this case, a stand-alone S/&wj;MIME
                  processing application.  Note that this mechanism is provided as a
                  convenience for implementations in certain environments.  A proper
                  S/&wj;MIME implementation MUST use the media types and MUST NOT rely on
                  the file extensions.

                  about the security applied (signed or enveloped) along with
                  information about the contained content.  This specification defines

                  In order for consistency to be obtained with future specifications,
                  the following guidelines SHOULD be followed when assigning a new
                  smime-type parameter.
                  <list style="numbers">
                    <t>
                      If both signing and encryption can be applied to the content,
                      then three values for smime-type SHOULD be assigned "signed-*", "authEnv-*",
                      and "enveloped-*".  If one operation can be assigned, then this
                      can be omitted.  Thus, since "certs-only" can only be signed,
                      "signed-" is omitted.

                      "OID.&lt;oid&gt;" is recommended (for example,
                      "OID.2.16.840.1.101.3.4.1.2" would be AES-128 CBC).

            <section title="Creating a Signed-Only Message" anchor="Signed-Only">
              <t>
                There are two formats for signed messages defined for S/&wj;MIME:
                <list style="symbols">
                  <t>
                    application/&wj;pkcs7-mime with SignedData.
                  </t>
                  <t>

                    multipart/signed.
                  </t>
                </list>
              </t>
              <t>
                In general, the multipart/signed form is preferred for sending, and
                receiving agents MUST be able to handle both.
              </t>
              <section title="Choosing a Format for Signed-Only Messages">
                <t>
                  There are no hard-and-fast rules as to when a particular signed-only
                  format is chosen.  It depends on the capabilities of all the
                  receivers and the relative importance of receivers with S/&wj;MIME
                  facilities being able to verify the signature versus the importance
                  of receivers without S/&wj;MIME software being able to view the message.
                </t>
                <t>
                  Messages signed using the multipart/&wj;signed format can always be
                  viewed by the receiver whether or not they have S/&wj;MIME software.
                  They can also be viewed whether they are using a MIME-native user
                  agent or they have messages translated by a gateway.  In this
                  context, "be viewed" means the ability to process the message
                  essentially as if it were not a signed message, including any other
                  MIME structure the message might have.
                </t>
                <t>

                  Messages signed using the SignedData format cannot be viewed by a
                  recipient unless they have S/&wj;MIME facilities.  However, the
                  SignedData format protects the message content from being changed by
                  benign intermediate agents.  Such agents might do line wrapping or
                  content-transfer encoding changes that would break the signature.
                </t>

                <t>
                  This signing format uses the application/&wj;pkcs7-mime media type.  The
                  steps to create this format are:

                  <t>  The MIME entity is prepared according to <xref target="MimePrep"/>.
</t>
                  <t>  The MIME entity and other required data are processed into a
                  CMS object of type SignedData.
                  </t>
                  <t>  The SignedData object is wrapped in a CMS ContentInfo
                  object.

                  </list>
                </t>
                <t>
                  The smime-type parameter for messages using application/&wj;pkcs7-mime
                  with SignedData is "signed-data".  The file extension for this type

                <t>
                  The protocol parameter MUST be "application/&wj;pkcs7-signature".  Note
                  that quotation marks are required around the protocol parameter
                  because MIME requires that the "/" character in the parameter value
                  MUST be quoted.
                </t>
                <t>
                  The micalg parameter allows for one-pass processing when the
                  signature is being verified.  The value of the micalg parameter is
                  dependent on the message digest algorithm(s) used in the calculation
                  of the Message Integrity Check.  If multiple message digest
                  algorithms are used, they MUST be separated by commas per [MIME-
                  SECURE].  The values to be placed in the micalg parameter SHOULD be
                  from the following:

                  (Historical note: some early implementations of S/MIME emitted and
                  expected "rsa-md5", "rsa-sha1", and "sha1" for the micalg parameter.)
                  Receiving agents SHOULD be able to recover gracefully from a micalg
                  parameter value that they do not recognize.  Future names for this
                  parameter will be consistent with the IANA "Hash Function Textual

                This section describes the format for compressing a MIME entity.
                Please note that versions of S/&wj;MIME prior to version 3.1 did not

                use of a capability to indicate the ability to receive CompressedData
                is described in <xref target="RFC3274"/> and is the preferred method for
                compatibility.

                <t>  The MIME entity to be compressed is prepared according to

                <t>  The MIME entity and other required data are processed into a

                object.
</t>

                The smime-type parameter for compressed-only messages is "compressed-

            <section title="Multiple Operations" anchor="MultipleOperations">
              <t>
                The signed-only, enveloped-only, and compressed-only MIME formats can
                be nested.  This works because these formats are all MIME entities
                that encapsulate other MIME entities.
              </t>
              <t>
                An S/&wj;MIME implementation MUST be able to receive and process
                arbitrarily nested S/&wj;MIME within reasonable resource limits of the
                recipient computer.
              </t>
              <t>
                It is possible to apply any of the signing, encrypting, and
                compressing operations in any order.  It is up to the implementer and
                the user to choose.  When signing first, the signatories are then
                securely obscured by the enveloping.  When enveloping first the
                signatories are exposed, but it is possible to verify signatures
                without removing the enveloping.  This can be useful in an
                environment where automatic signature verification is desired, as no
                private key material is required to verify a signature.
              </t>
              <t>
                There are security ramifications to choosing whether to sign first or
                encrypt first.  A recipient of a message that is encrypted and then
                signed can validate that the encrypted block was unaltered, but
                cannot determine any relationship between the signer and the
                unencrypted contents of the message.  A recipient of a message that
                is signed then encrypted can assume that the signed message itself
                has not been altered, but that a careful attacker could have changed
                the unauthenticated portions of the encrypted message.
              </t>
              <t>
                When using compression, keep the following guidelines in mind:
                <list style="symbols">
                  <t>
                    Compression of binary encoded encrypted data is discouraged,
                    since it will not yield significant compression.  Base64
                    encrypted data could very well benefit, however.
                  </t>
                  <t>
                    If a lossy compression algorithm is used with signing, you will
                    need to compress first, then sign.

              <t>
                The certificate management message or MIME entity is used to

              <t>
                A sending agent that signs messages MUST have a certificate for the
                signature so that a receiving agent can verify the signature.  There
                are many ways of getting certificates, such as through an exchange
                with a certification authority, through a hardware token or diskette,
                and so on.
              </t>
              <t>
                S/&wj;MIME v2 <xref target="SMIMEv2"/> specified a method for "registering" public keys
                with certificate authorities using an application/&wj;pkcs10 body part.
                Since that time, the IETF PKIX Working Group has developed other
                methods for requesting certificates.  However, S/&wj;MIME v4.0 does not
                require a particular certificate request mechanism.

            <section title="Identifying an S/MIME Message">
              <t>
                Because S/&wj;MIME takes into account interoperation in non-MIME
                environments, several different mechanisms are employed to carry the
                type information, and it becomes a bit difficult to identify S/&wj;MIME
                messages.  The following table lists criteria for determining whether
                or not a message is an S/&wj;MIME message.  A message is considered an
                S/&wj;MIME message if it matches any of the criteria listed below.

              <t>
                The file suffix in the table below comes from the "name" parameter in
                the Content-Type header field, or the "filename" parameter on the
                Content-Disposition header field.  These parameters that give the

            <t>
              A receiving agent MUST provide some certificate retrieval mechanism
              in order to gain access to certificates for recipients of digital
              envelopes.  This specification does not cover how S/&wj;MIME agents

            <t>
              At a minimum, for initial S/&wj;MIME deployment, a user agent could
              automatically generate a message to an intended recipient requesting
              that recipient's certificate in a signed return message.  Receiving
              and sending agents SHOULD also provide a mechanism to allow a user to
              "store and protect" certificates for correspondents in such a way so
              as to guarantee their later retrieval.

              This specification uses Public-Key Cryptography technologies.  It is
              assumed that the private key is protected to ensure that it is not
              accessed or altered by unauthorized parties.
            </t>
            <t>
              It is impossible for most people or software to estimate the value of
              a message's content.  Further, it is impossible for most people or
              software to estimate the actual cost of recovering an encrypted
              message content that is encrypted with a key of a particular size.
              Further, it is quite difficult to determine the cost of a failed
              decryption if a recipient cannot process a message's content.  Thus,
              choosing between different key sizes (or choosing whether to just use
              plaintext) is also impossible for most people or software.  However,
              decisions based on these criteria are made all the time, and
              therefore this specification gives a framework for using those
              estimates in choosing algorithms.

            <t>
              The choice of 2048 bits as the RSA asymmetric key size in this
              specification is based on the desire to provide at least 100 bits of
              security.  The key sizes that must be supported to conform to this
              specification seem appropriate for the Internet based on <xref target="RFC3766"/>.
              Of course, there are environments, such as financial and medical
              systems, that may select different key sizes.  For this reason, an
              implementation MAY support key sizes beyond those recommended in this
              specification.

              Receiving agents that validate signatures and sending agents that
              encrypt messages need to be cautious of cryptographic processing
              usage when validating signatures and encrypting messages using keys
              larger than those mandated in this specification.  An attacker could
              send certificates with keys that would result in excessive
              cryptographic processing, for example, keys larger than those
              mandated in this specification, which could swamp the processing
              element.  Agents that use such keys without first validating the
              certificate to a trust anchor are advised to have some sort of
              cryptographic resource management system to prevent such attacks.
            </t>
            <t>
              Using weak cryptography in S/&wj;MIME offers little actual security over
              sending plaintext.  However, other features of S/&wj;MIME, such as the
              specification of AES and the ability to announce stronger
              cryptographic capabilities to parties with whom you communicate,
              allow senders to create messages that use strong encryption.  Using
              weak cryptography is never recommended unless the only alternative is
              no cryptography.
            </t>
            <t>
              RSA and DSA keys of less than 2048 bits are now considered by many
              experts to be cryptographically insecure (due to advances in
              computing power), and should no longer be used to protect messages.
              Such keys were previously considered secure, so processing previously
              received signed and encrypted mail will often result in the use of
              weak keys.  Implementations that wish to support previous versions of
              S/&wj;MIME or process old messages need to consider the security risks
              that result from smaller key sizes (e.g., spoofed messages) versus
              the costs of denial of service.  If an implementation supports
              verification of digital signatures generated with RSA and DSA keys of
              less than 1024 bits, it MUST warn the user.  Implementers should
              consider providing different warnings for newly received messages and
              previously stored messages.  Server implementations (e.g., secure
              mail list servers) where user warnings are not appropriate SHOULD
              reject messages with weak signatures.
            </t>
            <t>
              Implementers SHOULD be aware that multiple active key pairs can be
              associated with a single individual.  For example, one key pair can
              be used to support confidentiality, while a different key pair can be
              used for digital signatures.
            </t>
            <t>
              If a sending agent is sending the same message using different
              strengths of cryptography, an attacker watching the communications
              channel might be able to determine the contents of the strongly
              encrypted message by decrypting the weakly encrypted version.  In
              other words, a sender SHOULD NOT send a copy of a message using
              weaker cryptography than they would use for the original of the
              message.
            </t>
            <t>
              Modification of the ciphertext can go undetected if authentication is
              not also used, which is the case when sending EnvelopedData without
              wrapping it in SignedData or enclosing SignedData within it.
              This is one of the reasons for moving from EnvelopedData to AuthEnvelopedData as the authenticated encryption algorithms provide the authentication without needing the SignedData layer.
            </t>
            <t>
              If an implementation is concerned about compliance with National
              Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) key size
              recommendations, then see <xref target="SP800-57"/>.
            </t>
            <t>
              If messaging environments make use of the fact that a message is
              signed to change the behavior of message processing (examples would
              be running rules or UI display hints), without first verifying that
              the message is actually signed and knowing the state of the
              signature, this can lead to incorrect handling of the message.
              Visual indicators on messages may need to have the signature
              validation code checked periodically if the indicator is supposed to
              give information on the current status of a message.
            </t>
            <t>
              Many people assume that the use of an authenticated encryption algorithm is all that is needed to be in a situtation where the sender of the message will be authenticated.
              In almost all cases this is not a correct statement.
              There are a number of preconditions that need to hold for an authenticated encryption algorithm to provide this service:
              <list style="symbols">
                <t>
                  The starting key must be bound to a single entity.
                  The use of a group key only would allow for the statement that a message was sent by one of the entities that held the key but will not identify a specific entity.
                </t>
                <t>
                  The message must have exactly one sender and one recipient.
                  Having more than one recipient would allow for the second recipient to create a message that the first recipient would believe is from the sender by stripping them as a recipient from the message.
                </t>
                <t>
                  A direct path needs to exist from the starting key to the key used as the content encryption key (CEK) which guarantees that no third party could have seen the resulting CEK.
                  This means that one needs to be using an algorithm that is called a "Direct Encryption" or a "Direct Key Agreement" algorithm in other contexts.
                  This means that the starting key is used directly as the CEK key, or that the starting key is used to create a secret which then is transformed into the CEK via a KDF step.
                </t>
              </list>
              S/MIME implementations almost universally use ephemeral-static rather than static-static key agreement and do not use a pre-existing shared secret when doing encryption, this means that the first precondition is not met.
              There is a document <xref target="RFC6278"/> which defined how to use static-static key agreement with CMS so that is readably doable.
              Currently, all S/MIME key agreement methods derive a KEK and wrap a CEK.
              This violates the third precondition above.
              New key key agreement algorithms that directly created the CEK without creating an intervening KEK would need to be defined.
            </t>
            <t>
              Even when all of the preconditions are met and origination of a message is established by the use of an authenticated encryption algorithm, users need to be aware that there is no way to prove this to a third party.
              This is because either of the parties can successfully create the message (or just alter the content) based on the fact that the CEK is going to be known to both parties.
              Thus the origination is always built on a presumption that "I did not send this message to myself."
            </t>
            <t>
              All of the authenticated encryption algorithms in this document use counter mode for the encryption portion of the algorithm.
              This means that the length of the plain text will always be known as the cipher text length and the plain text length are always the same.
              This information can enable passive observers to infer information based solely on the length of the message.
              Applications for which this is a significant problem need to provide some type of padding algorithm so that the length of the message does not provide this information.

    <section title="Historic Mail Considerations" anchor="HistoricMail">
      <t>
        Over the course of updating the S/MIME specifications, the set of recommended algorithms has been modified each time the document has been updated.
        This means that if a user has historic emails and their user agent has been updated to only support the current set of recommended algorithms some of those old emails will no longer be accessible.
        It is strongly suggested that user agents implement some of the following algorithms for dealing with historic emails.
      </t>

      <t>
        This appendix contains a number of references to documents that have been obsoleted or replaced, this is intentional as frequently the updated documents do not have the same information in them.
      </t>

      <section title="DigestAlgorithmIdentifier">
        <t>
          The following algorithms have been called our for some level of support by previous S/MIME specifications:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              SHA&nbhy;1 was dropped in <xref target="SMIMEv4.0"/>.
              SHA-1 is no longer considerd to be secure as it is no longer collision-resistant.
              The IETF statement on SHA-1 can be found in <xref target="RFC6194"/> but it is out-of-date relative to the most recient advances.
            </t>
            <t>
              MD5 was dropped in <xref target="SMIMEv4.0"/>.
              MD5 is no longer considered to be secure as it is no longer collision-resistant.

      </section>
      
      <section title="Signature Algorithms">
        <t>
          There are a number of problems with validating signatures on sufficently historic messages.
          For this reason it is strongly suggested that UAs treat these signatures differently from those on current messages.
          These problems include:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              CAs are not required to keep certificates on a CRL beyond one update after a certificate has expired.
              This means that unless CRLs are cached as part of the message it is not always possible to check if a certificate has been revoked.
              The same problems exist with OCSP responses as they may be based on a CRL rather than on the certificate database.
            </t>
            <t>
              RSA and DSA keys of less than 2048 bits are now considered by many experts to be cryptographically insecure (due to advances in computing power).
              Such keys were previously considered secure, so processing of historic  signed messages  will often result in the use of weak keys.
              Implementations that wish to support previous versions of S/&wj;MIME or process old messages need to consider the security risks that result from smaller key sizes (e.g., spoofed messages) versus the costs of denial of service.
              <vspace blankLines="1"/>
              <xref target="SMIMEv3.1"/> set the lower limit on suggested key sizes for creating and validation at 1024 bits.
              Prior to that the lower bound on key sizes was 512 bits.
            </t>
            <t>
              Hash functions used to validate signatures on historic messages may longer be considered to be secure.
              (See below.)
              While there are not currently any known practical pre-image or second pre-image attacks against MD5 or SHA&nbhy;1, the fact they are no longer considered to be collision resistent the security levels of the signatures are generally considered suspect.
            </t>
            <t>
              The previous two issues apply to the certificates used to validate the binding of the public key to the identity that signed the message as well.

              S/&wj;MIME v2 clients are only required to verify digital signatures using the rsaEncryption algorithm with SHA&nbhy;1 or MD5, and might not implement id-dsa-with-sha1 or id-dsa at all.
            </t>
            <t>
              S/&wj;MIME v3 clients might only implement signing or signature verification using id-dsa-with-sha1, and might also use id-dsa as an AlgorithmIdentifier in this field.
            </t>
            <t>
              Note that S/&wj;MIME v3.1 clients support verifying id-dsa-with-sha1 and rsaEncryption and might not implement sha256withRSAEncryption.

    <section title="Moving S/MIME v2 Message Specification to Historic Status" anchor="V2Historic">
      <t>
        The S/&wj;MIME v3 <xref target="SMIMEv3"/>, v3.1 <xref target="SMIMEv3.1"/>, and v3.2 <xref target="SMIMEv3.2"/>
        are backwards compatible with the S/&wj;MIME v2 Message Specification
        <xref target="SMIMEv2"/>, with the exception of the algorithms (dropped RC2/40
        requirement and added DSA and RSASSA-PSS requirements).  Therefore,
        it is recommended that RFC 2311 <xref target="SMIMEv2"/> be moved to Historic
        status.

        Many thanks go out to the other authors of the S/&wj;MIME version 2
        Message Specification RFC: Steve Dusse, Paul Hoffman, Laurence
        Lundblade, and Lisa Repka.  Without v2, there wouldn't be a v3, v3.1,
        v3.2 or v4.0.
